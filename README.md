## üçù About

Food Explorer is an end-to-end application developed as part of a challenge, with the aim of creating an interactive menu for a fictional restaurant.</br>
It has two main personas: the administrator, responsible for the restaurant, and the user, who explores and selects the dishes. The administrator can create, view, edit and delete dishes, while the user can view all registered dishes and obtain detailed information by clicking on a specific dish. The project encompasses both the frontend and the backend, based on the layout provided in Figma.
